* **Objective** - to implement a `CurrencyConverter` capable of identifying exchange rates between any two arbitrary types of currency
* **Purpose** - to demonstrate use of
    * object orientation
    * enums  

## Instructions
* Create a program that can convert between different currencies without loss of universal value.


### Exchange Rates

| Currency | Rate |
|----------|------|
| Universal Currency    | 1.00   |
| Us Dollar             | 2.00   |
| Euro                  | 1.88   |
| British Pound         | 1.64   |
| Indian Rupee          | 136.64 |
| Australian Dollar	    | 2.70   |
| Canadian Dollar       | 2.64   |
| Singapore Dollar      | 2.86   |
| Swiss Franc           | 2.02   |

## Food for thought
* Consider the following:
    * 1 Euro is 1.88 Universal Currency
    * 1 US Dollar is 2.00 Universal Currency
    * 1 US Dollar is 0.94 Euro



# Planning and Execution: 
Make sure your program passes the unit tests.
* make sure your last commit, after you have finished, is labelled `finished`
* are you getting what needs to be done at the end of the lab?
* don't overthink this.  it's just a way for us to see that you're getting it.
